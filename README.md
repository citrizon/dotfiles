# Citrizon's dotFiles!~
This is a repository of my dotfiles seperated by branches. You can check out the branches for my dotfiles for specific themes. Each branch has a setup script that has the same options, certain branch setups can have different settings, to view those settings;

First, clone the repository by executing this command (Replace the `<Branch>` with the branch you want to clone):
```
git clone -b <Branch> https://github.com/citrizon/dotfiles
```
Second, change your working directory to the repository by executing this command:
```
cd dotfiles
```
After that, you can finally view the options by executing this command:
```
./setup -h
```
This branch (main branch) contains necessary setup files for creating a new branch. You can create your own dotfiles by just forking this branch only.
